# bmp_to_acad_scr
Java utility that converts a .BMP into an autocad script.

I wrote this utility a long time ago when I had to process a folder of bmp files that I needed to conver to AutoCAD drawings.  This utility reads the .bmp file, and creates lines between connected dots, or single element lines in points with only a single pixel.  It's not prretty, but it does the job.
